# HTTP 
It is a client server protocol which defines how a client will send a request to a server (http request) and how a server will respond (http response). 

HTTP is a application layer protocol. 
It has some methods eg. GET POST DELETE PUT etc
Get - you are requesting some data
post - giving something to server to process
put - updating something in server
delete - delete data from the server 

Every application layer protocol needs a transport layer protocol( TCP and UDP ). 

Http uses Tcp inside it. 
It is a stateless protocol and server doesnt store any info about the client. `
