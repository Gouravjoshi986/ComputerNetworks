# Topologies 

1. Bus - every system is connected to a single line. (main branch) (since everything is transmitted via a cable only one person can send data at a time) (if it gets broken network will shut down)

2. Ring - connected in a ring fashion. every system communicates with one another.
if two computers need to communicate they need to go through all computers between them. (if it gets broken network will shut down)
(lot of unnecessary calls)

3. Star - one central device to which all the computers are connected. (comunication via central device) (if the central device fails network will go down)

4. Tree - combination of bus and star topology
in a bus everybody can have a star topology.

5. Mesh - every single computer is connected with every single computer. (expensive scalability issues)

# Structure of network 
eg. 
Order                          Received        --> application layer
 |                                |
Amazon                         Amazon 
 |                                |
Delivery company            Delivery company  
 |                                |
Transported    ------------>  Transported


This is similar to how the internet works. 
# OSI MODEL  - Open systems interconnection model
* standard way of how communication happens 

1. Application layer   ---> its implemented in software. the user will interact with it and it contains the application.
* Data is sent from application layer to presentation layer   
protocols - http / ftp etc

2. Presentation layer  ---> it gets data and converts the data into machine understandable foramt. this process is called translation. 
Before next processing the data us encoded/encrypted for protection . 
* also provides abstraction. 
data is also compressed. (SSL protocol is used )

3. Session layer  ---> helps in setting up and managing the connections.  helps in sending and receiving the data followed by termination of connected sessions. (authorization and authentication)

4. Transport layer  ---> it makes sure the data is transported successfully. 
* segmentation - data is divided in small units called segments and every packet contains source and destinations port number and a sequence number to reassemble the data. 
* Flow control - controls the amount of data that is being transported
* error control - adds checksum to every segment
connection oriented transmission - tcp 
connectionless oriented transmission - udp (faster)

5. Network layer  ---> it works for transmission of data segments from one computer to another that is located in a different network. 
* This is where the router lives. it performs routing. 
* its function is logical addressing. 
ip addressing done in network layer is called logical addressing assigns the sender and receivers ip address and a subnet mask to segment and forms ip packets. 
* load balancing also happens here 

6. Data link layer  --->  This data packet is converted to physical address (mac address) this is called physical addressing.  
* mac address is a 12 digit alpha numeric number 
of network interface. 
* provides media access control (how data is placed and received from media)

7. Physical link layer  ---> contains hardware / wire etc. transfers electrical or other type of signals. 

So the process will occur as 
 sender side             Receiver side
