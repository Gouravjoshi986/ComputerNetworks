All servers and computers are identified by their ip.

Everyb device on internet has an ip address. 
# Format =  X.X.X.X   and each X can have numbers ranging from 0 to 255.

ISP (internet service provider)  --> Modem/Router (it has a global ip address which is going to be same for all the devices connected to it)
--> Devices (differant devices connected to the router will also be given a local ip address which will be differant by dhcp-dynamic host conf. protocol) 

The request made by any of the device will go through the ip of the modem. on getting response the modem will decide which device sent the request. 

# Ports  
The ip address helps to identify the device to which the data will be transferred. 
* The port number helps to identify the app/program to send the data. 

* Ports are 16 Bit number so total possible port numbers are 2^16 (approx 65,000). 
* All the HTTP stuff happens on port 80. 
* MONGO DB has a port number of 27017. 
* Port number 0 - 1023  are reserved ports.
* 1024 - 49152 are also registered to some applications
* Sql server has a port of 1433. 

# Speed 
mega bits per second that is 10^6 bits / second. 

# Guided way and unguided way of communication
* Two computers are connected via wires- guided way (faster)

* Two computers are not connected - wifi / Bluetooth /3G/4G/LTE - unguided way 

* The countries in the world are connected via wires under the ocean. (submarine cable map website) (managed in india by tata) (The one which connects india runs from france,uae,india,japan,korea).

* LAN - local area network.    (Locality)
* MAN - metropolitan area network  (cities)
* WAN - wide area network (countires)
* SoNET - synchronous optical networking - carry network via optic cables (larger area)
* frame realy - way to connect lan to wan. 
 

* modem can convert a digital signal into analog signal.  
* router is a device which routes the data packet based on their ip addresses. 

isp are connected to bigger isp. 
tier 1 isp in india is tata.
