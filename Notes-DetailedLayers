# TCP / IP Model 

also known as internet protocol suit
similar to osi model but layers are reduced. 

1. Application
2. Transport 
3. Network
4. Data Link 
5. Physical 

* this is used practically while the osi model is a theoretical concept. 

# Application layer

- main layer that the user interact with. 
- whatsapp/browser etc. 
- lies on our devices 

connection type 
1. client server architecture
Server - high availability must be there 

2. Peer to peer architecture - clients are connected to each other no big data center or server.  Key advantage is we can scale it very rapidly . A good example is bit torrent. 

* some networking devices 
1. repeater - its main job is to regenerate a signal over same network when it becomes too weak to transmit over longer distance. it doesnt amplifies the signal it just regenerates it bit by bit. 
2. Hub -  it is a multi port repeater. ( repeater is 2 port)   -> hub is of two types active(own power supply used for extending distance) and passive(cant be used to extend distance)
3. Bridge - a type of repeater with added functionality of filtering by reading mac addresses. used at data link layer. 
4. Switch - multi port bridge (very efficient)
5. Router - at network layer to route the packets as per ip addresses
6. Gateway - Passage to connect two networks together ,works as a messenger agent to take data from one system to another, also called protocol convertors. 
7. Brouter - bridging router 


* sockets = interface between a process and the internet 
* ports = if many processes are working in one application. then ephemeral ports are used to identify which process do we need to send the data to.   
The ephemeral ports are assigned by the application randomly on client side.
